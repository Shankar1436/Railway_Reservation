# Railway Reservation System

A Java GUI application for Train Booking and Management.
The main objectives of the project is to allow the passenger to view, book and cancel their train reservations. The project aims to improve the existing systems of booking trains by trying to implement user freedom of booking by allowing the user or passenger to choose their own seats.

## Coach Selection Algorithm
 This System allows seat selection, but to balance the weight distribution of the train, this "Coach Selection Algorithm" comes into picture.
 This Algorithm is based on 'Divide and Conquer' , where the algorithm is designed to pick the right coach so that the mass is evenly distributed.
*	Initially, the coaches are picked at random, in which the customer is able to select the seat/s of their choice, checking the availability of the same.
*	Once that is done, the next user would be prompted to a different coach based on the algorithm which would be chosen according to the existing weights on each coach. 
*	A special case of the same (with six coaches) is represented below where the initially picked coach is 1 (i.e the random function return coach 1 as its output)
*	Once the first passenger has finished selecting their seats, the second passenger is then allowed to book onto a different coach(in this case, the sixth), where they can select their seats.
*	Based on their selection, the coach selection algorithm moves back to the left side where once again the divide an conquer effect comes into play, allowing the third coach to be chosen. 
*	This algorithm continues off in this manner until all seats are completely filled.
